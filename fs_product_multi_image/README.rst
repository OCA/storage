Usage
=====

On the category and product form, a new tab allows you to add images to the
related object. The images can be specific to the model or you can use an
existing one.

On the link forms, you can add an image tag in addition to the image. In
the specific case of the product template, you can also specify for which
variant attribute values the image is valid.

On the product variant form, the image tag will be automatically filled whith
the image tag of the product template for the same variant attribute values.

In every case, a main image is computed and used as the default image for the
object. It depends on the sequence of the images (first one is the main one).

Changelog
=========

16.0.1.0.2 (2023-10-04)

**Bugfixes**

- Ensures the variant_image_ids are sorted by sequence and name. Before this
  change, the order was random and could change between runs. (`#282 <https://github.com/OCA/storage/issues/282>`_)
