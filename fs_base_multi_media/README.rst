This addon allows you to store media file into external filesystem from odoo.
It also provides is a technical mixin model to ease the creation of other models
that need to be linked to multiple medias stored into external filesystems.

The models provided by this addon are:

* ``fs.media``: a model that stores a reference to an media stored into
  an external filesystem.
* ``fs.media.relation.mixin``: an abstract model that can be used to
  as base class for models created to store an media linked to a model.
  This abstract model defines fields and methods to transparently handle
  2 cases:
  * the media is specific to the model.
  * the media is shared between multiple models and therefore is a ``fs.media`` instance linked to the mixin.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Usage
=====

To be able to create and or manages shared images, you must have the ``Media Manager``
role. If you do not have this role, as an authenticated user, you can
only view the shared images.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Add dedicated widget to ease the addition of new media to a model linked to
  multiple medias. (As it's the case in the *storage_image_product* addon)
