   :local:

Configuration
=============

1. Go to Settings > Technical > FS Storage > FS Storage
2. Select a filesystem you want to use for backups. **NOTE: Make sure
   you don't use the filestore as backup location otherwise it's
   possible you'll back up the backup**
3. Enable ``Use For Backups``
4. Follow it (using the chatter) if you want to get notified when a
   backup fails
5. To know if the backup is working correctly you can run the scheduled
   action (``Backup database and delete old backups``) manually to test
   it.

Usage
=====

The backup is done automatically by a scheduled action
(``Backup database and delete old backups``).

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

-  **Configurable backup frequency**: e.g. backup every 7 days in s3 and
   every 4 hours on a FTP server.
