1. Go to Settings > Technical > FS Storage > FS Storage
2. Select a filesystem you want to use for backups. 
   **NOTE: Make sure you don't use the filestore as backup location otherwise it's possible you'll back up the backup**
3. Enable `Use For Backups`
4. Follow it (using the chatter) if you want to get notified when a backup fails
5. To know if the backup is working correctly you can run the scheduled action 
   (`Backup database and delete old backups`) manually to test it.
