This addon defines a new field **FSImage** to use in your models. It is a
subclass of the **FSFile** field and comes with the same features. It extends
the **FSFile** field with specific properties dedicated to images. On the field
definition, the following additional properties are available:

* **max_width** (int): maximum width of the image in pixels (default: ``0``, no limit)
* **max_height** (int): maximum height of the image in pixels (default: ``0``, no limit)
* **verify_resolution** (bool):whether the image resolution should be verified
  to ensure it doesn't go over the maximum image resolution (default: ``True``).
  See `odoo.tools.image.ImageProcess` for maximum image resolution (default: ``50e6``).

On the field's value side, the value is an instance of a subclass of
`odoo.addons.fs_file.fields.FSFileValue`. It extends the class to allows
you to manage an alt_text for the image. The alt_text is a text that will be
displayed when the image cannot be displayed.
