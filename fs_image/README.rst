This addon defines a new field **FSImage** to use in your models. It is a
subclass of the **FSFile** field and comes with the same features. It extends
the **FSFile** field with specific properties dedicated to images. On the field
definition, the following additional properties are available:

* **max_width** (int): maximum width of the image in pixels (default: ``0``, no limit)
* **max_height** (int): maximum height of the image in pixels (default: ``0``, no limit)
* **verify_resolution** (bool):whether the image resolution should be verified
  to ensure it doesn't go over the maximum image resolution (default: ``True``).
  See `odoo.tools.image.ImageProcess` for maximum image resolution (default: ``50e6``).

On the field's value side, the value is an instance of a subclass of
`odoo.addons.fs_file.fields.FSFileValue`. It extends the class to allows
you to manage an alt_text for the image. The alt_text is a text that will be
displayed when the image cannot be displayed.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Usage
=====

This new field type can be used in the same way as the odoo 'Image' field type.

.. code-block:: python

  from odoo import models
  from odoo.addons.fs_image.fields import FSImage

  class MyModel(models.Model):
      _name = 'my.model'

      image = FSImage('Image', max_width=1920, max_height=1920)


.. code-block:: xml

  <record id="my_model_form" model="ir.ui.view">
      <field name="name">my.model.form</field>
      <field name="model">my.model</field>
      <field name="arch" type="xml">
          <form>
              <sheet>
                  <group>
                      <field name="image" class="oe_avatar"/>
                  </group>
              </sheet>
          </form>
      </field>
  </record>


In the example above, the image will be resized to 1920x1920px if it is larger than that.
The widget used in the form view will also allow the user set an 'alt' text for the image.


A mode advanced and useful example is the following:

.. code-block:: python

  from odoo import models
  from odoo.addons.fs_image.fields import FSImage

  class MyModel(models.Model):
      _name = 'my.model'

      image_1920 = FSImage('Image', max_width=1920, max_height=1920)
      image_128 = FSImage('Image', max_width=128, max_height=128, related='image_1920', store=True)


.. code-block:: xml

  <record id="my_model_form" model="ir.ui.view">
      <field name="name">my.model.form</field>
      <field name="model">my.model</field>
      <field name="arch" type="xml">
          <form>
              <sheet>
                  <group>
                      <field
                          name="image_1920"
                          class="oe_avatar"
                           options="{'preview_image': 'image_128', 'zoom': true}"
                       />
                  </group>
              </sheet>
          </form>
      </field>
  </record>

In the example above we have two fields, one for the original image and one for a thumbnail.
As the thumbnail is defined as a related stored field it's automatically generated
from the original image, resized at the given size and stored in the database.
The thumbnail is then used as a preview image for the original image in the form view.
The main advantage of this approach is that the original image is not loaded in the form view
and the thumbnail is used instead, which is much smaller in size and faster to load.
The 'zoom' option allows the user to see the original image in a popup when clicking on the thumbnail.

For convenience, the 'fs_image' module also provides a 'FSImageMixin' mixin class
that can be used to add the 'image' and 'image_medium' fields to a model. It only
define the medium thumbnail as a 128x128px image since it's the most common use case.
When using an image field in a model, it's recommended to use this mixin class
in order ensure that the 'image_medium' field is always defined. A good practice
is to use the `image_medium` field as a preview image for the `image` field in
the form view to avoid to overload the form view with a large image and consume
too much bandwidth.

.. code-block:: python

  from odoo import models

  class MyModel(models.Model):
      _name = 'my.model'
      _inherit = ['fs_image.mixin']


.. code-block:: xml

  <record id="my_model_form" model="ir.ui.view">
      <field name="name">my.model.form</field>
      <field name="model">my.model</field>
      <field name="arch" type="xml">
          <form>
              <sheet>
                  <group>
                      <field
                          name="image"
                          class="oe_avatar"
                          options="{'preview_image': 'image_medium', 'zoom': true}"
                      />
                  </group>
              </sheet>
          </form>
      </field>
  </record>
