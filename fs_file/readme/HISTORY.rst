16.0.1.0.4 (2023-10-17)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bugfixes**

- Browse attachment with sudo() to avoid read access errors

  In models that have a multi fs image relation, a new line
  in form will trigger onchanges and will call the fs.file model
  'convert_to_cache()' method that will try to browse the attachment
  with user profile that could have no read rights on attachment model. (`#288 <https://github.com/OCA/storage/issues/288>`_)


16.0.1.0.3 (2023-10-05)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bugfixes**

- Fix the *mimetype* property on *FSFileValue* objects.

  The *mimetype* value is computed as follow:

  * If an attachment is set, the mimetype is taken from the attachment.
  * If no attachment is set, the mimetype is guessed from the name of the file.
  * If the mimetype cannot be guessed from the name, the mimetype is guessed from
    the content of the file. (`#284 <https://github.com/OCA/storage/issues/284>`_)


16.0.1.0.1 (2023-09-29)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Features**

- Add a *url_path* property on the *FSFileValue* object. This property
  allows you to easily get access to the relative path of the file on
  the filesystem. This value is only available if the filesystem storage
  is configured with a *Base URL* value. (`#281 <https://github.com/OCA/storage/issues/281>`__)


**Bugfixes**

- The *url_path*, *url* and *internal_url* properties on the *FSFileValue*
  object return *None* if the information is not available (instead of *False*).

  The *url* property on the *FSFileValue* object returns the filesystem url nor
  the url field of the attachment. (`#281 <https://github.com/OCA/storage/issues/281>`__)
