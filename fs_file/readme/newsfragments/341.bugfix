Fixes the creation of empty files.

Before this change, the creation of empty files resulted in a constraint
violation error. This was due to the fact that even if a name was given
to the file it was not preserved into the FSFileValue object if no content
was given. As result, when the corresponding ir.attachment was created in
the database, the name was not set and the 'required' constraint was violated.
