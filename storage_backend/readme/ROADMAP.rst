* Transactions: fsspec comes with a transactional mechanism that once started,
  gathers all the files created during the transaction, and if the transaction
  is committed, moves them to their final locations. It would be useful to
  bridge this with the transactional mechanism of odoo. This would allow to
  ensure that all the files created during a transaction are either all
  moved to their final locations, or all deleted if the transaction is rolled
  back. This mechanism is only valid for files created during the transaction
  by a call to the `open` method of the file system. It is not valid for others
  operations, such as `rm`, `mv_file`, ... .
