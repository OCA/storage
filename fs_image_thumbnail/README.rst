This module extends the **fs_image** addon to support the creation and the storage of
thumbnails for images. This module is a **technical module** and is not
meant to be installed by end-users. It only provides a mixin to be used
by other modules and a model to store the thumbnails.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Use Cases / Context
===================

In some specific cases you may need to generate and store thumbnails of images in Odoo.
This is the case for example when you want to provide image in specific sizes for a website
or a mobile application.

This module provides a generic way to generate thumbnails of images and store them in a
specific filesystem storage. Indeed, you could need to store the thumbnails in a different
storage than the original image (eg: store the thumbnails in a CDN) to make sure the
thumbnails are served quickly when requested by an external application and to
avoid to expose the original image storage.

This module uses the `fs_image <https://github.com/oca/storage/blob/16.0/fs_image/README.rst>`_
module to store the thumbnails in a filesystem storage.

The `shopinvader_product_image <https://github.com/shopinvader/odoo-shopinvader/
blob/16.0/shopinvader_product_image>`_ addon uses this module to generate and
store the thumbnails of the images of the products and categories to be accessible
by the website.

Usage
=====

This addon provides a convenient way to get and create if not exists image
thumbnails. All the logic is implemented by the  abstract model
`fs.image.thumbnail.mixin`. The main method is `get_or_create_thumbnails` which
accepts a *FSImageValue* instance, a list of thumbnail sizes and a base name.

When the method is called, it will check if the thumbnail exists for the given
sizes and base name. If not, it will create it.

The `fs.thumbnail` model provided by this addon is a concrete implementation of
the abstract model `fs.image.thumbnail.mixin`. The motivation to implement all the
logic in an abstract model is to allow developers to create their own thumbnail
models. This could be useful if you want to store the thumbnails in a different
storage since you can specify the storage to use by model on the `fs.storage`
form view.

Creating / retrieving thumbnails is as simple as:

.. code-block:: python

  from odoo.addons.fs_image.fields import FSImageValue

  # create an attachment with a image file
  attachment = self.env['ir.attachment'].create({
      'name': 'test',
      'datas': base64.b64encode(open('test.png', 'rb').read()),
      'datas_fname': 'test.png',
  })

  # create a FSImageValue instance for the attachment
  image_value = FSImageValue(attachment)

  # get or create the thumbnails
  thumbnails = self.env['fs.thumbnail'].get_or_create_thumbnails(
      image_value, [(800,600), (400, 200)], 'my base name')



If you've a model with a *FSImage* field, the call to `get_or_create_thumbnails`
is even simpler:

.. code-block:: python

  from odoo import models
  from odoo.addons.fs_image.fields import FSImage

  class MyModel(models.Model):
      _name = 'my.model'

      image = FSImage('Image')

  my_record = cls.env['my.model'].create({
      'image': open('test.png', 'rb'),
  })

  # get or create the thumbnails
  thumbnails = record.image.get_or_create_thumbnails(my_record.image,
      [(800,600), (400, 200)], 'my base name')
