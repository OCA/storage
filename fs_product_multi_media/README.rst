Usage
=====

On the category and product form, a new tab allows you to add medias to the
related object. The medias can be specific to the model or you can use an
existing one.

When attaching a media to a product you can also specify for which variant
attribute values the media is valid.

Changelog
=========

16.0.1.0.2 (2023-10-04)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bugfixes**

- Ensures the variant_media_ids are sorted by sequence and name. Before this
