This addon is a technical addon providing a set of models to ease the
creation of other models that need to be linked to multiple images stored
into external filesystems.

The models provided by this addon are:

* ``fs.image``: a model that stores a reference to an image stored into
  an external filesystem.
* ``fs.image.relation.mixin``: an abstract model that can be used to
  as base class for models created to store an image linked to a model.
  This abstract model defines fields and methods to transparently handle
  2 cases:
  * the image is specific to the model.
  * the image is shared between multiple models and therefore is a ``fs.image`` instance linked to the mixin.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Usage
=====

To be able to create and or manages shared images, you must have the ``Image Manager``
role. If you do not have this role, as an authenticated user, you can
only view the shared images.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Add dedicated widget to ease the addition of new images to a model linked to
  multiple images. (As it's the case in the *storage_image_product* addon)
