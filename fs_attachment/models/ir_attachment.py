        want them to be fast to read.
        They are generally < 50KB (default configuration) so they don't take
        that much space in database, but they'll be read much faster than from
        the object storage.

        * a database doesn't have thousands of them
        * of course better for performance
        * better portability of a database: when replicating a production
          instance for dev, the assets are included

        Where the key is the beginning of the mimetype to configure and the
        value is the limit in size below which attachments are kept in DB.
        0 means no limit.

        These limits are applied only if the storage is the default one for

        Whatever the result of the current transaction, the information of files
