============
Storage File
============


External file management depending on Storage Backend module.

It include these features:
* link to any Odoo model/record
* store metadata like: checksum, mimetype

Use cases (with help of additionnal modules):
- store pdf (like invoices) on a file server with high SLA
- access attachments with read/write on prod environment and only read only on dev / testing

If the images are served by Odoo and you want to use them in reports, then you should fetch the image URL
using context parameter 'storage_image_url_for_report'.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Update README with the last model of README when migration to v11 in OCA
* No file deletion / unlink
